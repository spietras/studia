Text game about typical students life at EITI

## Game mechanics

The game consists of several locations.
Each location has a quest that you have to perform in order to complete the game.
There is one final quest that unlocks when all other quests are completed.

You control your "character" by typing commands.
Each command performs some action according to the command type's logic.

The clue of adventure games is exploration.
So feel free to try all the commands you want.
That's the simplest way to progress towards the end.

If you don't know which commands are available in the current situation, just hit Enter.
It should give you some hints about what to do.
