It's pretty straightforward.

![Alt text](docs/previews.png "Previews")

You can hit the search button again to load more pictures. They should also load dynamically when you scroll down or resize the window to not leave empty space.

When some errors occur or all available pictures are loaded, you will be notified about this in the bottom right corner of your screen.

You can click on any preview to see details of the picture:
